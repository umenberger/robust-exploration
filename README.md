# robust-exploration
Code to reproduce examples in NeurIPS submission: Robust exploration in linear quadratic reinforcement learning.

Run: 

multistep_rrl_empirical.m ~ to reproduce numerical simulations in which the method is applied to the simulated system

multistep_rrl_theoretical.m _ to reproduce numerical simulations in which the method is applied, and costs are calculated based on theoretical worst-case system behavior.
